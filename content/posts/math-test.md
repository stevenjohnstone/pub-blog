This is a test post to demonstrate LaTeX support in Hugo.

## Inline Math

This is an example of an inline mathematical equation: $E=mc^2$. You can write your equations directly in the text.

Here is another one, the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Block Math

For larger equations, you can use display mode:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

This is the Gaussian integral. Here is the definition of the Fourier transform:

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ e^{-2\pi i \xi x}\ dx
$$

The setup should now be complete and ready for you to write your own mathematical articles!
